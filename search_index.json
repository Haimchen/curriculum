to ElmBridge!\nToday, you're going to be learning Elm! So exciting!\nThis tutorial is meant to be completed over the course of 5 hours, broken up into two chunks:\n\n2.5 hours on learning the basics of the language.\n3 hours building an Elm application from scratch — specifically, an emoji translator!\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you can expect to:\n\nKnow what Elm is, and why people use it.\nBe familiar with the core data structures of the language.\nUnderstand the architecture of Elm applications.\nBe able to build interactive front-end applications in Elm.\n\nThanks for coming! Let's get started.\nSetup\nWe're going to be working with:\n\nThe latest version of the Elm language platform.\nThe terminal.\nThe text editor of your choice.\nThe web browser of your choice.\n\nAt various points today, you'll also be asked to download code from GitHub, so internet access is also required.\nInstalling Elm\nIf you haven't done so already, follow the official Elm guide for installing the language platform.\nYou can verify everything is working by launching the Elm REPL (What is a REPL?) by running the following command in your terminal:\nelm-repl\n\nIf you see the following message, you are ready to go!\n---- elm-repl 0.17.1 -----------------------------------------------------------\n :help for help, :exit to exit, more at \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>\n"},"Why Elm.html":{"url":"Why Elm.html","title":"Intermission: Why Elm?","keywords":"","body":"Why Elm?\nIn this section, we'll talk about the advantages — and disadvantages! — of using Elm to make front-end applications.\nFirst, the basics: Elm is a language for building complex web interfaces. Much like CoffeeScript or JSX, Elm compiles to JavaScript; the Elm Platform takes your Elm code and turns it into JavaScript that any web browser can understand. In many ways, it operates similarly to front-end JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Ember.\nSo why do developers go to the trouble of using a whole new language instead of using a JavaScript framework? Indeed, Elm shares many of its opinions about architecture and code quality with those tools. However, Elm is different in one important way — because it is a distinct programming language and not simply a framework, Elm can strictly enforce its opinions.\nAnd the language has lots of rules! They are meant to push developers toward writing code that is easier to maintain and harder to break. For instance:\n\nIn Elm, a function always returns the same value for a given input. There is no notion of instance variables or this in Elm — the only thing a function can do is read the values of its arguments and call out to other functions. This quality of the language is called purity — no matter what context, a function will do the same thing every time.\n\nOnce a value is declared in an Elm application, it can never change. It's not possible, for instance, for a function to accidentally change its inputs, or for something to become undefined. If you need to add an element to a list, there is no way to do so destructively — instead, you have to create a new list with all the elements you specify. Values like these are called immutable.\n\nEverything in Elm has a type. Nothing can ever break that contract. For instance, it is not possible for a function to return a string in some cases and a number in other cases — the type contract of a function can never be violated. Those same constraints operate on everything in the language, including variables and complex data structures. That is why Elm is called a statically typed language.\n\n\nBecause of these rules, entire categories of bugs are impossible in Elm, like:\n\n\"I expected this function to return a number, but it returned nil instead.\"\n\"Sometimes when I call this function it fails, even though I gave it the exact same input.\"\n\"Something is changing the value of my variable, and I'm not sure where it's happening.\"\n\nThese errors cannot happen in Elm because of the language's strictness. Indeed, the rules mean that Elm applications can never accidentally crash. There are no runtime exceptions — no undefined is not a function or undefined method for nil:NilClass. Consequently, Elm developers spend much less time in the Developer Tools console than JavaScript developers, and less time in the browser in general.\nThat strictness can come with real downsides, though. If you are coming from an object-oriented, dynamically typed language like Ruby or JavaScript, Elm can feel like a straightjacket at first. There are no each or for loops in Elm — instead, you have to use higher-order functions like map, filter, and fold. The += operator has no place in the language either, since it would mutate the variable on its left-hand side. If you need to change a value deep inside a nested data structure, you can't simply read the value and mutate it, as you could in other languages.\nYou may wonder how Elm developers can survive with all these restrictions. The strictness of the language opens up other doors, however. Because Elm requires all programs to follow its rules, the Elm compiler will tell you exactly what's wrong with your program if you make a mistake. It will tell you if you made an if/else expression return two different kinds of values, if you are calling a function with too many arguments, or if you are referencing a variable that does not exist.\nDeveloping with Elm often feels like an ongoing conversation with the compiler, gently pushing you toward writing better code. Often, you don't even need to look at your application in the browser while implementing a feature — you can trust the compiler to tell you if you are going in the right direction.\nYou may be asking yourself why you should choose to learn a language that's so different from other tools in the ecosystem. We'd argue that the experience of working in an alien environment, even if it's just for a little while, can be fruitful. You are probably not used to dealing with the constraints of purity, immutability, and static typing, which together make up the basic tenets of functional programming. These constraints will push you to solve problems in creative ways, and hopefully you will learn strategies that you can employ in other languages.\nWe make no claim that functional programming is better than other types of programming, but it definitely is different. We strongly believe that learning a new way to think about programming will make you a better developer, in the same way that learning a foreign language makes you appreciate the architecture and beauty of the languages you already know.\nSo let's get started!\n"},"Getting Started.html":{"url":"Getting Started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nGoals\n\nLearn how to use the Elm REPL\nLearn how to manipulate strings and numbers in Elm\nLearn how to call functions\nLearn where to find documentation about the Elm core library\n\nSteps\n Step 1\nLaunch the Elm REPL again by running the following command:\nelm-repl\n\nNow that you are in the REPL, you can write your first Elm code! Code you should try out in the REPL is written on lines starting with >.\nYou can enter values, and Elm will tell you the type of the values.  Try typing\nstrings, numbers, and simple mathematical expressions:\n> \"Hello\"\n\"Hello\" : String\n> 100\n100 : number\n> 100.5\n100.5 : Float\n> 50 / 7\n7.142857142857143 : Float\n> 4 + 3 * (6 - 2)\n16 : number\n Step 2\nYou can define and refer to variables:\n> x = 5\n5 : number\n> y = 3\n3 : number\n> x + y\n8 : number\n Step 3\nYou can concatenate strings using the ++ operator:\n> \"Hello\" ++ \", World\"\n\"Hello, World\" : String\n> name = \"Anna\"\n\"Anna\" : String\n> \"Hello, \" ++ name ++ \"!\"\n\"Hello, Anna!\" : String\n Step 4\nIf you try to perform operations that don't make sense, Elm will try to tell you\nwhat's wrong:\n> 10 + \"Betsy\"\n-- TYPE MISMATCH --------------------------------------------- repl-temp-000.elm\n\nThe right argument of (+) is causing a type mismatch.\n\n3|   10 + \"Betsy\"\n          ^^^^^^^\n(+) is expecting the right argument to be a:\n\n    number\n\nBut the right argument is:\n\n    String\n\nHint: To append strings in Elm, you need to use the (++) operator, not (+).\n\n\nHint: I always figure out the type of the left argument first and if it is\nacceptable on its own, I assume it is \"correct\" in subsequent checks. So the\nproblem may actually be in how the left and right arguments interact.\n Step 5\nTo call a function in Elm, you simply type the name of the function and any parameters you want to pass, separated by spaces.  No parentheses or commas are necessary.\nHere are some of the functions that are available by default in Elm: toString, max, min, sqrt, round, floor.  These are defined in the Basics module, which is always imported for you. You can read more about these and other functions in its documentation.\n> toString 10 ++ \"!\"\n\"10!\" : String\n> min 9 1\n1 : number\nTo disambiguate order of operations, use parentheses.\n> round (96 / 7)\n14 : Int\n Step 6\nLet's use some functions from the String module.\nFirst, we need to import the module.\n> import String\nThen any function we want to use is namespaced under String:\n> String.toUpper \"Carey\"\n\"CAREY\" : String\n> String.split \",\" \"Apple,Apricot,Avocado,Banana,Blackberry\"\n[\"Apple\",\"Apricot\",\"Avocado\",\"Banana\",\"Blackberry\"] : List String\n> String.join \" -- \" (String.split \",\" \"Apple,Apricot,Avocado\")\n\"Apple -- Apricot -- Avocado\" : String\n Step 7\nNow let's define and use our own functions.\nWe saw types before when we entered numbers and Strings into the console; functions have types too!\nWhen Elm shows the type of a function, it uses arrows -> and colons :. We've seen the colons already, when Elm told us the types of values (e.g., 14 : Int).\nThe arrows point to the return value.  Generally, the rightmost type is the return value, and the other types are the parameters to the function.  For example, Int -> String -> Float is the type of a function that takes two parameters: the first is an Int, the second is a String, and the function returns a Float.\n> multiplyByThree x = x * 3\n : number -> number\n> multiplyByThree 10\n30 : number\n> add a b = a + b\n : number -> number -> number\n> add 10 4\n14 : number\n> sayHello name = \"Hello, \" ++ name\n : String -> String\n> sayHello \"Janice\"\n\"Hello, Janice\" : String\n Step 8\nExit the Elm REPL by typing :exit, or CTRL-D.\n"},"The Basic Building Blocks of Elm.html":{"url":"The Basic Building Blocks of Elm.html","title":"The Basic Building Blocks of Elm","keywords":"","body":"The Basic Building Blocks of Elm\nIn this lesson, you'll learn how to work with the basic data structures of Elm. You'll be working with a custom application that we've written where you'll be asked to implement some basic transformations.\nGoals\n\nPractice defining and using functions in Elm\nLearn how to use strings, lists, and records.\n\nSteps\n Step 1\nGet a copy of the elm-basics code:\ngit clone https://github.com/elmbridge/elm-basics.git\ncd elm-basics\n\nStart Elm Reactor to build the project:\nelm-reactor\n\nNow open http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser, and go to Main.elm.\nYou should see something like this:\n\nThis application contains a series of unimplemented functions designed to teach you about the basic data structures of Elm. All the functions that you need to implement live in Main.elm. By default, you'll see some work-in-progress emojis, and when you successfully implement a function, you'll see a heart.  But if you'd like to customize the emojis or the colors, you can do so in Style.elm.  When you're done poking around, go back to Main.elm to start the exercises.\n Step 2\nLike many languages, Elm has a String data type to store text. In this step, you should complete all the unimplemented functions for the string section of the application. Once you're ready to get started, navigate to the sayHello function.\nsayHello friendsName =\n    \"\"\n\nYou'll notice that this assertion is currently failing in your browser. Your job is to make it pass! Once you have a guess, change and save the code in Main.elm — refresh your browser and you'll learn if you implemented it correctly. If you've made a syntax error, the page will display an error message that will tell you what to fix.\nYou should have enough to get started! A few tips:\n\nRemember, the ++ operator is used to add strings together.\nIf you want to transform a string in some way, you should use the String module to do so. For instance, if you wanted to get the last letter of a string, you might use the String.right function like this:\n\nString.right 1 someStringVariable\n\nIf you get stuck, flag down an instructor! They are here to help.\n Step 3\nElm has all the traditional structures for conditional logic, including if, else, case, and the ==, , >, &&, and || operators. (Note: the \"not equal\" operator is a non-standard /=.) Here's what that looks like in practice:\nnumberToWords num =\n  if num == 0 then\n    \"zero\"\n  else if num == 1 then\n    \"one\"\n  else\n    \"a number larger than one\"\n\n--here's the same function, implemented with a case expression\nnumberToWords num =\n  case num of\n    0 -> \"zero\"\n    1 -> \"one\"\n    _ -> \"a number larger than one\"\n\nElm enforces that all branches of an if or case expression must return the same type of value — so all if expressions must include a corresponding else clause, and all possible values must be accounted for in a case expression.\nTake a shot at completing the assertions for if expressions!\n Step 4\nIn Elm, you can use a List to store a collection of elements. Unlike dynamic languages, though, Elm lists are typed — every element in a list must be the same kind of thing. You can't have a list that stores both strings and numbers, for example.\nFor this step, you should complete all the List assertions. Some tips:\n\nIn another language, you might solve these assertions by creating an empty list, and incrementally adding things to it as you iterate over the passed-in list. That's not possible in Elm — once you've declared a variable in Elm, you can never change it. You will have to use more complicated List functions, like List.map.\nMost common functions that operate on lists live in the List module. The order of arguments to these functions may be disorienting — in functional programming languages, the convention is to have the data you are operating on be the last argument to a function, not the first.\nMany of these functions consume a function. To use them, you can use an anonymous function, like this:\n\n  List.map (\\list_element -> list_element * 2) [1,2,3]\n\nNote: the value after the \\ is the input to the function, while whatever is after the -> sign is the output.\nGood luck!\n Step 5\nJust like JavaScript has objects to store name-value pairs, Elm has records. Unlike JavaScript's objects, though, Elm treats the structure of a record as immutable. Once a record has been defined, you cannot add or remove a field, or change the type of a field.\nUnlike strings and lists, records are a special data type that has a special syntax for getting and setting values. You can create a record like this:\naNewRecordAppears =\n  { fieldOne = \"value\", anotherField = 1111 }\n\nTo get the value out of a record, you can use . syntax:\naNewRecordAppears.fieldOne\n\nAnd to update a specific field, you use | syntax:\n{ aNewRecordAppears | fieldOne = \"a new value for the specified field\" }\n\nThere is no Record module — all record functions are implemented through special syntax. You can learn more about the type in the official Elm guide on records.\nOnce you've finished this step, feel free to complete some of the bonus assertions, or look at some of the implementation code in the main function. Next up, we'll talk about how to build applications in Elm.\n"},"Building User Interfaces.html":{"url":"Building User Interfaces.html","title":"Intermission: Building User Interfaces","keywords":"","body":"Building User Interfaces\nCongratulations on completing the last lesson! If this was your first experience with a functional programming language, it may have been difficult. The jump from object oriented programming to functional programming can be scary, and Elm's syntax can be confusing for recent transplants. This initial struggle is totally normal, and will eventually dissipate as you continue to work with Elm.\nAs we discussed earlier, Elm is distinctive in its enforcement of purity, immutability and static typing. That's all well and good for the toy problems that you just solved, but you may be wondering how Elm can model a complex and interactive UI given these constraints. If nothing can change in Elm, how can Elm applications model systems that change?\nAs we will see, Elm has a series of abstractions built into the language that are helpful in modeling user interfaces. Together, these abstractions form The Elm Architecture, which is a detailed template for constructing an application in Elm. Similar to how the strictness of the language pushes you to write code in a particular way, The Elm Architecture pushes you to structure applications in a way that prioritizes maintainability.\nThe rest of this tutorial is meant to teach you what this means in practice. Piece by piece, you'll be building and extending an interactive user interface in Elm. By the end of the day, you should have a better sense of what it feels like to develop in Elm and what it's like to work with a functional programming language.\nOff we go!\n"},"The Elm Architecture.html":{"url":"The Elm Architecture.html","title":"The Elm Architecture","keywords":"","body":"The Elm Architecture\n\nIn this lesson, we'll run a simple Elm application and learn how it all fits together!\nGoals\n\nRun your first Elm application.\nLearn how every part of an Elm application works.\n\nSteps\n Step 1\nDownload the skeleton app here: https://github.com/elmbridge/elmoji-translator/releases/tag/hello-world, navigate to the downloaded folder in your terminal, and run the following command:\nelm-make Main.elm\n\nelm-make compiles your application — it turns your Elm code into JavaScript code that your browser can understand. The above command uses Main.elm as the entry point to your application. It compiles that file, along with any files it references, and creates index.html, which is a simple HTML page that includes all the compiled JavaScript for your application.  (It's also possible to compile into a JavaScript file if you want to use your own HTML file.)\nElm comes with another tool that makes it easy to quickly develop your application: elm-reactor starts a local development server that will automatically compile your Elm code (and, if there are any errors, give you helpful error messages on what you need to fix).  Let's start it up:\nelm-reactor\n\nNow that elm-reactor is running, you can go to http://localhost:8000/Main.elm in your web browser to see your compiled application.  Whenever you refresh the page, elm-reactor will recompile your code and show you the result.\nYou should now have a fully functional Elm application, that looks like this:\n\n Step 2\nSo how does any of this work? Let's start with Main.elm, which (by convention) is the entry point to an Elm application.\nmain =\n    Html.App.beginnerProgram\n        { model = Model.init\n        , view = View.view\n        , update = Update.update\n        }\n\nThe main function describes the initialization logic for your Elm application. Every entry point file requires a main function. It requires a record with three basic pieces of every Elm application:\n\nThe initial model, which describes the state of our application. Our application will create new model values as the user interacts with it.\nThe view function, which is responsible for converting a model into HTML for Elm to render to the UI. It also maps all possible user actions to the appropriate messages.\nThe update function, which is responsible for updating the application's state based on triggered messages. It consumes the current application state (the model) and a single message, and returns a new model that describes the application's new state.\n\nBut wait, didn't we say that a value can never change in Elm? What's exactly changing here? Good question — let's come back to it when we finish looking at the rest of the pieces.\n\nThe initial model, view function, and update function together form a triad that is required in every Elm application. For more complicated programs, a few other pieces are required — however, for this session, we'll focus on the core triad.\n Step 3\nLet's investigate each of these pieces one by one. First, let's check out the init function in Model.elm to see what the initial state of our application is.\ninit =\n    { text = \"hello world!\" }\n\nAs you can see, Model.init takes no arguments and returns a record, which is a name-value map with predefined structure. This particular record has a single field called text, with a value of \"hello world!\". This record represents the state of our application — it is the only thing in our entire application that can change over time. As the model changes, the UI should change to reflect its new value.\nIt is convention to write a type alias to describe your application's state, and call it Model, like this:\ntype alias Model =\n    { text : String }\n\nWe'll learn more about type aliases later in this tutorial, but for now, it's worth noting that it is simply used for convenience. It's an easy way for other Elm developers to tell exactly what information is stored in your model.\n Step 4\nNow, let's take a look at our view function in View.elm, which is responsible for converting our model into HTML. Any changes between the produced HTML and the last rendered HTML will be rendered to the UI by Elm.\nview model =\n    Html.div\n        [ Html.Attributes.class \"skeleton-elm-project\" ]\n        [ Html.node \"link\"\n            [ Html.Attributes.rel \"stylesheet\"\n            , Html.Attributes.href \"stylesheets/main.css\"\n            ]\n            []\n        , Html.div\n            [ Html.Attributes.class \"waves-effect waves-light btn-large\"\n            , Html.Events.onClick Update.ChangeText\n            ]\n            [ Html.text model.text ]\n        ]\n\nIf you have worked with Angular, React, Ember, or another front-end framework, this part may be somewhat familiar to you. Every front-end framework has its own syntax for describing HTML, and Elm is no different. The resulting HTML looks like this:\n\n  \n  \n    hello world!\n  \n\n\nThe view function uses the Html module to render HTML nodes. Html.div is a function that consumes two lists — a list of attributes, and a list of children. Our first div has one attribute (a class attribute that provides a class for styling) and it has two children: a link tag and another div.\nThe link tag has two attributes (rel, and href) and no children.\nThe child div has two attributes (another class attribute and an onClick handler). It also has one child: a plain-text HTML node, rendered using the Html.text function.\nWhat does model.text mean in the context of our view function? This function is responsible for rendering the application's current state as HTML — and that state is stored in the model variable. Every time the application's state changes, this function will be called with a new model value — if model.text is different than the last time this function was called, the UI will update with new text!\nYou may wonder how this function can be performant — every time the model changes, even slightly, our view function has to recalculate every HTML element in your application. If you have hundreds of elements, and dozens of potential changes, how does Elm not collapse under the load?\nGood news: Elm is optimized to be performant under pressure. It uses a library called virtual-dom to ensure that the entire page doesn't have to re-render every time the application's state changes. React and Ember use similar strategies, although Elm has more tricks up its sleeve because of its functional nature. The exact details are out of scope for this tutorial, however — just know that you generally don't have to worry about HTML rendering performance when writing Elm.\nBefore we move on, let's take another look at that onClick handler:\nHtml.Events.onClick Update.ChangeText\n\nThis line of code is key to our application — it maps a potential user action to a message that can cause our application to change. In this case, clicking on our div causes the Update.ChangeText message to be sent.\nThere are lots of potential user actions defined in the Html.Events module — as with JavaScript, you can track when a user clicks an element, presses a key, or submits a form. If you don't map these user actions to a message, however, they will be ignored by your application.\n Step 5\nLet's return to the question of change we saved for later when we were looking at init: What does it mean when we say model changes? Let's take another look at our diagram:\n\nEven though we said model, view, and update together form a triad, you can see that model is not a first-class circle in this diagram. In fact, model is just passed around as an argument to view and update functions.\nThis model argument may be different each time those functions are called. So you see, changing the model doesn't mean modifying its value, but pointing the model argument at a different value.\nThe update function in Update.elm is responsible for this transformation. When a message is triggered by the UI, update consumes the specified message and the current model, and returns a new model for the view function to render.\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        ChangeText ->\n            if model.text == \"hello world!\" then\n                { model | text = \"goodbye world!\" }\n            else\n                { model | text = \"hello world!\" }\n\nWe just saw that the ChangeText message can be triggered when the user clicks our button. When a message is sent, this function applies some conditional logic:\n\nIf the current application's state (stored in the model variable) has a .text value of \"hello world!\", the function returns a new model with a value of \"goodbye world!\".\nIf not, then model.text must be already equal to \"goodbye world!\", so the function returns a model with a text value  of \"hello world!\".\n\nEither way, the new model will be converted to HTML, and any changes will be rendered to the UI by our view function.\nWait, there's only one possible action tracked in our UI — why have a case expression at all?  This is convention in Elm-land. As you build an application, there will be more and more kinds of messages to which your update function will have to react. Consequently, this case expression will get longer and longer to accommodate the new messages.\nIt's worth taking a look at the Msg type in Update.elm:\ntype Msg\n    = ChangeText\n\nand later on:\nupdate : Msg -> Model.Model -> Model.Model\n\nThis is an example of a union type declaration in Elm. We'll go further into the details in a future lesson, but for right now, you can think of this as a way to model messages in our application. The above code declares two things (reading from that function definition first):\n\nthe update function takes two arguments, the first is a Msg, and the second is a Model.\nany value that is of Msg type will be exactly one of the values specified in the type definition (in this case, there is only one acceptable value which is ChangeText.) If we wanted to add another possible value for message, we would have to change this declaration of the union type Msg to include the new possibility.\n\nElm doesn't force us to use a union type called Msg for messages — we could just as easily model messages as strings, numbers, or records. It is convention, however, to model data using union types whenever appropriate. Don't worry if you are somewhat lost — union types are one of the more difficult concepts to learn as a beginner to Elm, and it's fine for now if they are simply magic words you know you can recite.\nNow that we're done touring the basics of the Elm triad, let's get building!\n"},"Making It Dynamic.html":{"url":"Making It Dynamic.html","title":"Making It Dynamic","keywords":"","body":"Making it Dynamic\nIn this lesson, we'll start making our emoji translator application! Eventually, the user will be able to \"encrypt\" messages using an emoji key, so that users can pass secret messages to each other. The final product will look something like this:\n\nWe need to walk before we run, though! First, we'll make an application that simply consumes text input provided by the user and displays it back to the page.\nGoals\n\nDownload and run the Skeleton Elmoji app.\nUnderstand how to use Elm to make things change on the page.\n\nSteps\n Step 1\nDownload the Skeleton app here: https://github.com/elmbridge/elmoji-translator/releases/tag/release-0 and navigate to the downloaded folder. Start elm-reactor in your terminal:\nelm-reactor\n\nAnd then go to http://localhost:8000/Main.elm in your web browser. You should now have a fully functional Elm application running in your browser! It should look like this:\n\n Step 2\nAs you may have already noticed, however, this Elm application doesn't do anything. While you can enter text on the page, the application seems to ignore it.\nOur goal is to make the text that the user enters display back to them, like this:\n\nAs we learned in the last lesson, every Elm application is built upon the model, view, and update triad. This app is no different – in order to implement this feature, we may need to change all three.\nFirst, let's take a look at the model in Model.elm:\ntype alias Model =\n    { currentText : String }\n\nFor this application, the model is a record that contains a currentText field that must be a string. That's perfect for our feature — as a user inputs text into the application, we'll update the currentText field, and reflect its new value to the UI.\nLet's verify that user text input is mapped to a message. First, let's look in View.elm, which is much bigger than it was in the last lesson! Specifically, let's take a look at the code for input field.\nHtml.input\n  [ Html.Attributes.type' \"text\"\n  , Html.Attributes.class \"center\"\n  , Html.Attributes.placeholder \"Let's Translate!\"\n  , Html.Events.onInput Update.SetCurrentText\n  ]\n  []\n\nIt's worth taking a moment to discuss the API for the Html module. Almost all functions in this module have the same structure — they consume a list of HTML attributes (like class, id, display, etc.) as well as a list of child elements that are nested inside them.\nWhile the API is somewhat verbose, much of its contents are probably familiar to you. In this case, the code is generating an input element with a type of text and a class of center and some placeholder text. The resulting HTML looks like this:\n  \n\nThe final attribute comes from the Html.Events module, which describes which Update message is sent when the element hears an input event. In this case, a message called SetCurrentText is sent, along with the element's current text. (SetCurrentText String is actually a tagged value — don't worry, we'll cover that in a future lesson!)\nThis is great! When this message is sent, we can update our model with the new value. To do that, let's check out Update.elm:\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        SetCurrentText newText ->\n            -- currently, this does nothing!\n            model\n\nWhenever an update message is sent, the Update.update function consumes the sent message, the current model, and returns a new model to render. Currently, the SetCurrentText message is handled by this function, but the function simply returns the old model.\nLet's change that. Instead, we should have the update function update the model's currentText value whenever the message SetCurrentText is sent. Let's use record update syntax to do so:\nupdate msg model =\n    case msg of\n        SetCurrentText newText ->\n          { model | currentText = newText }\n\nOnce you've made the change, go back to your web browser (to http://localhost:8000/Main.elm), refresh the page, and elm-reactor will recompile your application.\nIf there are any errors from the compiler, elm-reactor will show them to you.  If there aren't any errors, you will see the updated application!\n Step 3\nGreat, so we're now updating the model every time the user inputs text into our application. However, that's only half the battle — we still need to display the application's currentText back to the user!\nThankfully, the skeleton already includes some styling for us. All we need to do is add code to our View.view function to display a paragraph tag right after our input tag, with the model's currentText as its value. The resulting HTML should look like this:\n  It's happening!!!\n\nIn Elm, the code to generate that HTML would look like this:\nHtml.p\n    [ Html.Attributes.class \"center output-text emoji-size\" ]\n    [ Html.text \"It's happening!\" ]\n\nNote: Html.text is a special kind of Html function, that produces a plain-text node. In this case, we've built a paragraph element with a nested child element that is simply plain text.\nInsert the above code into the View.view function, as a list element after the div with a class of .input-field. Once you think you have it, recompile your code to see if it worked.\n Step 4\nWe don't want the text to always be It's happening!, though. Instead, the text of the paragraph node should reflect the currentText of the current model. As the model changes, this paragraph node should change as well.\nYou'll notice that the View.view function consumes a model. This model represents the current state of the application! So if we use record getter syntax, we can pull the currentText value out of the model and use it, like this:\nHtml.p\n    [ Html.Attributes.class \"center output-text emoji-size\" ]\n    [ Html.text model.currentText ]\n\nRecompile your code, and you should have a fully functional, dynamic application!\n"},"Emojification.html":{"url":"Emojification.html","title":"Emojification!!!","keywords":"","body":"Emojification\nUp until now, this project has had a severe lack of emojis. In this lesson, we'll learn how to use an external module to translate text into emojis. Once we're done, it should look something like this:\n\nYour code should currently look like this. You can either carry your code over from the last lesson, or download and recompile the code from GitHub.\nGoals\n\nAccess and utilize code in other modules\nBe able to write helper functions\nUnderstand where to place domain-specific code\n\nSteps\n Step 1\nSpoiler alert: Emojis are complicated! And creating a decoder-ring-style translator between plain text and emojis is no small feat. Thankfully, one of your teammates has already written an emoji converter library for you to use, so you don't have to deal with that complexity! The code is already in your skeleton, in EmojiConverter.elm.\n(In the style of secret decoder rings, EmojiConverter implements a simple substitution cipher that works by replacing all the letters in a message with the corresponding letter in a shifted alphabet.  A shared, secret value (called the \"key\") determines how much shifting occurs, and the original message can later be recovered if the key is known.)\nWe'll need to use that code to convert the display text from plain text to emojis. But how do we pull that code in to our View.elm file?\nThat's where the Elm module system comes into play. Modules are simply collections of related functions. They are helpful for encapsulating behavior, and for providing clear boundaries between libraries. Let's take a look at the first few lines of EmojiConverter.elm:\nmodule EmojiConverter exposing (textToEmoji, emojiToText, supportedEmojis)\n\nLike all Elm files, EmojiConverter.elm starts off by telling us what module it defines. In other files, we'll be able to call its functions by using the EmojiConverter namespace, in the same way we use the Html or List namespaces.\nThis line also tells us the public API for the EmojiConverter module — regardless of what else is defined in this file, other files can, at most, access the three functions defined above. Of the three publicly accessible functions, the textToEmoji function seems like exactly what we are looking for.\nLet's import the module into our View.elm file, by adding this to the list of imports:\nimport EmojiConverter\n\nNow let's try using the textToEmoji function in our output text section.\nHtml.p\n    [ Html.Attributes.class \"center output-text emoji-size\" ]\n    [ Html.text (EmojiConverter.textToEmoji model.currentText) ]\n\nLet's try to compile this, and...uh oh! You should be getting the following error:\n-- TYPE MISMATCH -------------------------------------------------- ././View.elm\n\nThe argument to function `text` is causing a mismatch.\n\n42|                       Html.text (EmojiConverter.textToEmoji model.currentText)\n                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFunction `text` is expecting the argument to be:\n\n    String\n\nBut it is:\n\n    String -> String\nThis error might seem like gibberish at first, but stay strong — Elm error messages are very good at telling you exactly what you need to know. In this case, it seems that, instead of passing Html.text a string to render, we are passing it a function that takes a string and returns a string. In Elm-land, that often means that you passed too few arguments into a function — if a function takes two arguments, and you only provided it one, it will return a partially-applied function that still needs one more argument!\nAs you may have guessed, it seems like we're using EmojiConverter.textToEmoji incorrectly. Let's take a look at its definition in EmojiConverter.elm to figure out how to use it:\ntype alias Key =\n    String\n\n\ntextToEmoji : Key -> String -> String\ntextToEmoji key text =\n  ...\n\nApparently, textToEmoji takes two arguments — a Key and a String, and returns a converted String. If we look a few lines above in the file, we see that Key is simply an alias for String.\nOf course! Like any good decoder ring, the EmojiConverter library uses a key to determine how to encode and decode messages. In this case, the key can be one of the emojis supported by the library. In order to turn text into emojis, we need to give it a key, as well as the text we hope to translate.\nLet's go back to View.elm, and hard-code an emoji as the translation key.\nHtml.p\n    [ Html.Attributes.class \"center output-text emoji-size\" ]\n    [ Html.text (EmojiConverter.textToEmoji \"😅\" model.currentText) ]\n\nRecompile the code, refresh your browser, and you should be in business!\n Step 2\nWhile this solution works, I'd argue that the code has become harder to follow. Let's refactor!\nFirst off, let's extract a helper function for translating text. in View.elm, we can add a function that consumes a model and returns emojis:\ntranslateText model =\n    EmojiConverter.textToEmoji \"😅\" model.currentText\n\nNote: Type signatures are always optional in Elm, but they are highly encouraged — type signatures can be a good form of documentation, and they help the compiler make educated guessed about what went wrong when your code fails to recompile. Feel free to add your own to translateText!\nWe can now use this function in our View.view function. Since it's defined in the same file as it's being used, we don't even have to use the View namespace. We can simply invoke it as such:\nHtml.text (translateText model)\n\nRecompile your code and make sure everything still works!\n Step 3\nFinally, let's pull out the hard-coded emoji key into something more readable. Since the key denotes domain-specific information about your app, the best place to put that information would be in Model.elm. Remember, modules in Elm are simply collections of functions that are similar to each other. Just because we put a function in Model.elm doesn't mean it has anything to do with our model record, or with application state in general.\nLet's create a defaultKey function in Model.elm that simply returns the \"😅\" emoji. Since Model.elm includes exposing (..) in its definition, we don't need to explicitly white-list our new defaultKey function for export — all other files can access all functions in this file if requested.\nFinally, let's use our defaultKey function. In View.elm, switch out the reference to the \"😅\" emoji key with references to the new defaultKey function.\nOnce you think you've got it, recompile to make sure it worked. If you get stuck, check out the completed step on GitHub to see how we've implemented it, or flag down a TA or instructor.\n"},"Our First Full Feature.html":{"url":"Our First Full Feature.html","title":"Our First Full Feature","keywords":"","body":"Our First Full Feature\nWhile emojis are great, a one-way translator from text to emojis is not particularly useful.

You can either carry your code over from the last lesson, or download and recompile the code from GitHub.\nGoals\n\nWrite Elm view code using HTML as a template.\nAdd a new message for your application to consume.\nExtend a type alias and fix subsequent compiler errors.\nUse union types to store information in more literate ways.\n\nSteps\n Step 1\n First, let's start in View.elm, where we'll map user actions in the UI to messages for our application to consume.\n\nIn our case, we want to build a switch that will allow users to toggle between \"Translate Text\" and \"Translate Emoji.\" We can use the materialize.css lever component to do the job. Between the text input and paragraph tag that our View.view function produces, we want the following markup to appear:\n\n  \n    Translate Text\n    \n    \n    Translate Emoji\n  \n\n\nTake a shot at translating the above HTML to Elm and update the View.view function! Some tips if you get stuck:\n\nMost Html functions take two arguments: a list of attributes (produced by the Html.Attributes and the Html.Events modules), followed by a list of child elements. In this case, our div has one child (the label element), and the label element has four children!\nTo render plain text elements, use Html.text. It simply takes a string as its argument.\nCompile early and often! The Elm compiler will nudge you in the right direction if your syntax is off.\n\nIf you get stuck, flag down a TA or instructor to help you through it! Alternatively, you can see a working solution here.\n Step 2\nNow that we have a working lever, we need to wire it up to our Update.update function! Let's look at our Update.elm file, and see what messages our Update.update function can currently consume.\ntype Msg\n    = SetCurrentText String\n\nThis is a union type declaration. It defines a new type that we can use in our program, along with all its possible values. Specifically, the above code defines the Msg type, and declares that it has exactly one possible value – SetCurrentText String, which is triggered whenever the user inputs text into the translation box.\nEven though union types and values look similar, they operate in different parts of our program. A union type is just another type, like String or List, which we can use in our type signatures. Values, on the other hand, can only be used in our implementation code. For instance:\ntype Pet = Cat | Dog | Rabbit | Turtle\n-- this defines the union type `Pet` with four possible values\n\nmakeSound : Pet -> String\n-- union types, like `Pet`, can only be used in type signatures.\nmakeSound pet =\n    -- values like `Cat` and `Dog` can't be used in type signatures,\n    -- but they can be used inside functions.\n    if pet == Cat\n        \"meow\"\n    else if pet == Dog\n        \"woof\"\n    else\n        \"..silence..\"\n\nYou may be wondering what the String means after SetCurrentText. This is the syntax for declaring a tagged value, which we will learn more about in a future lesson. For now, know that a use of SetCurrentText must also include a string to be considered a valid message:\n-- valid value for `Msg`\nSetCurrentText \"some awesome text\"\n\n-- invalid values for `Msg`\nSetCurrentText 12345\nSetCurrentText \"string one\" \"string two\"\n\nBack to the task at hand: in order for the user to toggle between translation modes, we need a new message to our system. Let's add another possible value to our Msg union type declaration:\ntype Msg\n    = SetCurrentText String\n    | ToggleDirection\n\nWe'll make sure our lever triggers the new ToggleDirection Msg whenever the user clicks it!\nIf you try to compile now, you'll notice that the compiler realizes something is wrong:\n-- MISSING PATTERNS --------------------------------------------- ././Update.elm\n\nThis `case` does not have branches for all possibilities.\n\n13|>    case msg of\n14|>        SetCurrentText newText ->\n15|>            { model | currentText = newText }\n\nYou need to account for the following values:\n\n    Update.ToggleDirection\n\nAdd a branch to cover this pattern!\nHelpfully, the Elm compiler enforces case exhaustiveness – since our Update.update function doesn't handle our new ToggleDirection value, the compiler realizes that triggering that Msg will break our program. Let's fix it by adding another clause to our case expression, this time matching on the pattern ToggleDirection.\nToggleDirection ->\n    -- currently, this does nothing!\n    model\n\nFinally, let's make our view actually trigger our new Msg value. Add the following attribute to the lever's HTML in View.view:\nHtml.Events.onClick Update.ToggleDirection\n\nCompile, and make sure nothing is broken! If you want, you can see a working solution here.\n Step 3\nWhen our Update.update function receives a ToggleDirection message and the current model, it should return a new, changed model:\n\nEventually, our View.view function will reflect those changes to the user.\nFirst things first — we need to find a way to describe the current direction in our Model. Let's take a look at Model.elm:\ntype alias Model =\n    { currentText : String }\n\nThe code above declares that Model is a type alias for a specific record structure. A type alias works a lot like a union type declaration — it also produces a new type that we can use in our program. In this case, the Model type is just another name for \"a record with a single field called currentText.\"\nType aliases are helpful for making type signatures simple and readable. For example, you can see that Model is used in the type signature for init:\ninit : Model\ninit =\n    { currentText = \"\" }\n\nWithout this type alias, we would've had to write:\ninit : { currentText : String }\ninit =\n    { currentText = \"\" }\n\nNow back to business: we'll need to extend this type alias declaration, by adding another field to the record:\ntype alias Model =\n    { currentText : String\n    , direction: -- ????\n    }\n\nBut wait, what is direction? In other languages, we might describe the current direction as a string, with possible values \"emoji-to-text\" and \"text-to-emoji\". We could also model it as a boolean value, perhaps renaming it translatingTextToEmoji.\nIn Elm, we have a more powerful tool at our disposal: union types! We can simply create a union type that enumerates all possible values for a direction, which keeps the code readable and fault tolerant. In Model.elm, let's create a custom Direction type with two possible values:\ntype Direction\n    = TextToEmoji\n    | EmojiToText\n\nNow, we can use that new type in our Model type alias:\ntype alias Model =\n    { currentText : String\n    , direction : Direction\n    }\n\nIf you try to compile right now, you should get some errors: Our code wasn't written to handle a Model with a direction field! See if you can figure out what's wrong and fix it.\nNow that Model can describe the current translation direction, we need to change Update.update to correctly set the direction field when it consumes the ToggleDirection message.\nInside Update.update, we know two things – the current Msg we received, as well as the current state of the model, which includes its current direction. That's all the information we need – if the current model.direction is EmojiToText, Update.update should return a model with a direction value of TextToEmoji, and vice versa.\nWhen working with custom types, case expressions are helpful in writing conditional logic. In our case, the code would look something like this:\nToggleDirection ->\n    case model.direction of\n        Model.TextToEmoji ->\n            -- return a model with a direction value of `Model.EmojiToText`\n\n        Model.EmojiToText ->\n            -- return a model with a direction value of `Model.TextToEmoji`\n\nImplement the above code in Update.update, and make sure it compiles!\n Step 4\nNow to the final part of the feature: We need to reflect changes to the model in the UI!\n\nIn our case, we need to change our translation logic depending on the current model.direction.  Let's take a look at our View.translateText function:\ntranslateText model =\n    EmojiConverter.textToEmoji Model.defaultKey model.currentText\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nThe EmojiConverter exposes a emojiToText function that we can use if the current direction is Model.EmojiToText.\nThe translateText function also has access to the current model, which stores the current Direction.\nIn a similar manner to Update.update function, we can use a case expression to choose which EmojiConverter function to use.\n\nThat should be enough to get you started! If you are unsure, try to compile, and follow compiler errors until everything is fixed. If you get stuck, you can see a completed version of this feature here, or flag down a TA or instructor.\nCongratulations, you've completed your first full feature in Elm!\n"},"Choose Your Own Emoji.html":{"url":"Choose Your Own Emoji.html","title":"Choose Your Own Emoji","keywords":"","body":"Choose Your Own Emoji\nFor this lesson, we'll allow our users to choose which emoji to use when encoding their messages. That way, they can send secret messages to each other that can only be decoded if they have the right key! It will eventually look like this:\n\nThere's a lot to do! Let's do this!\nNote: Your code should currently look like this. You can either carry your code over from the last lesson, or download and recompile the code from GitHub.\nGoals\n\nUse transformation functions to render dynamic HTML.\nUse complex Html functions to render conditional classes.\nModel a domain using tagged values.\nImplement a full feature from start to finish.\n\nSteps\n Step 1\nAs we did with our last lesson, let's start first by updating View.elm with our new UI elements. The eventual markup should look like this:\n\n\n\n  Select Your Key\n  \n    \n      😁\n    \n    \n      😅\n    \n    \n  \n\n\nTake a crack at converting this to Elm. Some of this is straightforward — we already know how to render static elements with attributes and children using the Html module. We also already have a list of all supported emojis in EmojiConverter.supportedEmojis. But how will we render all those emojis without a lot of copying and pasting?\nElm shines in situations like this. Since View.view is simply Elm code, and Html.Html is just another type in Elm, we can use normal transformations to produce HTML. We can use EmojiConverter.supportedEmojis in combination with the List module to convert that list of emojis into a list of HTML elements!\nThe code in View.view can use a helper function to render all emoji keys, like this:\n  -- ...\n  [ Html.h4\n    [ Html.Attributes.class \"center\" ]\n    [ Html.text \"Select Your Key\" ]\n  , renderKeys\n  ]\n\nAnd we can write renderKeys to iterate over the list of supported emojis and call another helper function, renderKey.\nrenderKeys =\n    Html.div\n        [ Html.Attributes.class \"row\" ]\n        (List.map (\\emoji -> renderKey emoji) EmojiConverter.supportedEmojis)\n\nIt's worth taking a moment to explain what List.map is doing. Much like Array.prototype.map in JavaScript, List.map takes a function and a list, calling the function on each element on the list and returning a list of the produced values. The (\\... -> ...) syntax is how you define an anonymous function in Elm.\nIf you want to learn more, the List module is thoroughly documented on package.elm-lang.org. The site is a great resource if you want to learn more about the public API for available Elm packages and core modules.\nNow, it's your turn! Add the new markup to View.view, with the renderKeys and renderKey helper functions. If you get stuck, you can see a completed version of this step here.\n Step 2\nThere's one more part of the UI that we have to render — we have to display the currently selected key as selected. If we give the specified emoji .key-selector a class of .is-selected, it will display with a blue background. For now, we'll\nhard code the selected key to Model.defaultKey.\nWhen you have to conditionally attach classes to an HTML element in Elm, the Html.Attributes.classList function is helpful in simplifying the code. The function consumes a list of tuples, with each tuple containing a string (representing a class) and a boolean (describing whether the class should be attached to the element). The code for rendering the .key-selector element might look something like this:\nHtml.div\n    [ Html.Attributes.classList\n        [ ( \"key-selector\", True )\n        , ( \"is-selected\", emoji == Model.defaultKey )\n        ]\n    ]\n    [ Html.text emoji ]\n\nOnce you've added that code to your renderKey function, you should have a working, if static, UI!\n Step 3\nNow that we've updated the UI, we have to map our new user action to a message for our application to consume. Add the following line of code to your renderKey function, as an attribute to the element with a class of .key-selector:\nHtml.Events.onClick (Update.SetSelectedKey emoji)\n\nWhen this element is clicked, a Msg of Update.SetSelectedKey String will be triggered, which will eventually be consumed by our application.\nLike SetCurrentText String, SetSelectedKey String is a tagged value. In effect, we are saying that SetCurrentText and SetSelectedKey are only valid values of the Msg union type if they are accompanied by a string.\nTagged values are helpful for modeling systems with uneven information requirements. For instance, if we were modeling a coffee shop, we might structure our data like this:\ntype BrewingStrategy = PourOver | FrenchPress\n\ntype Milk = Cow | Soy | Almond\n\ntype alias NumberOfEspressoShots = Integer\n\ntype DrinkOrder\n  = BlackCoffee BrewingStrategy\n  | Latte NumberOfEspressoShots Milk\n  | HotChocolate Milk\n  | ColdBrew\n\nApparently, there's a lot of complexity bundled up in our drink orders! In some cases, we need to know what kind of milk the customer wants. In other cases, we need to know information specific to only one kind of drink. The above data model accounts for that complexity by using tagged values — a HotChocolate is only a valid DrinkOrder if it is accompanied by a Milk selection, and a BlackCoffee relies on another union type to determine the customer's preferred brewing strategy.\nWe could have also modeled this problem with a record, but the data would have likely been harder to follow. What would the .milk field on that record mean, if the customer wanted black coffee? Why would we need a .numberOfEspressoShots in order to make a hot chocolate?\nTagged values are also helpful in preventing bad data from propagating through our system. For instance, a drink order of \"single shot latte\" isn't enough in the real world — if we tried to make it, we wouldn't know what kind of milk our customer wanted. Tagged values protect us here — if we tried to use Latte 1 in a function that was expecting something of the type DrinkOrder, our code would fail to compile.\nSo let's wire up our new tagged value to Update.update! In order:\n\nAdd the aforementioned onClick attribute to the .key-selector element.\nAdd the new SetSelectedKey String value to Update.Msg, and ensure that Update.update handles the new case.\nFind a way to store the key information on the model, perhaps in a new field called selectedKey.\nEnsure that you the model initialization logic still works. We should start off the application with a model.selectedKey value of Model.defaultKey.\nImplement the SetSelectedKey String case of Update.update, so that it updates the model with the correct selectedKey.\n\nThat's a lot! Work slowly, and lean on your compiler for help. If you get stuck, you can see a completed version of this step here.\n Step 4\nNow that Update.update consumes our new message, we need to reflect changes to the model onto the UI. First off, we need to use our new model.selectedKey field to display to the user which key is currently selected. As of now, our renderKeys function does not consume model, so it has no idea about the current state of the application. Let's change that! renderKeys should look like this:\nrenderKeys model =\n    Html.div\n        [ Html.Attributes.class \"row\" ]\n        (List.map (\\emoji -> renderKey model emoji) EmojiConverter.supportedEmojis)\n\nYou will have to change the call site of renderKeys in View.view to match the new signature of the function, and you will have to change renderKey to consume a model. Once that's done, you can use model.selectedKey in place of Model.defaultKey when checking whether a key is selected. The UI should now show you which key is selected, as you click on them!\n Step 5\nAnd now, for the final step — we need to change our translation key based on the value of model.selectedKey! When you're done, your application should work like this:\n\nYou definitely know enough Elm to figure this out for yourself. However, if you get stuck, check out a working solution here.\nAnd with that, you've completed your first Elm application!\n"},"Deployment and Next Steps.html":{"url":"Deployment and Next Steps.html","title":"Deployment and Next Steps","keywords":"","body":"Deployment and Next Steps\nSince Elm code compiles to JavaScript, it can be very simple to host and deploy!

Hopefully, you now have an understanding of what it's like to be an Elm developer, and what it feels like to work with a functional, compiled language.\nBefore we finish, we should at least mention the things that this tutorial didn't cover, which will come up as you work more in Elm. Here's a non-exhaustive list:\n\nTypes and Type Signatures. Elm allows developers to constrain and document their code using these tools. They are highly encouraged — a well-factored type system makes code more descriptive and more fault-tolerant. Once you've learned more about types, some of the more esoteric Elm compiler messages will begin to make more sense as well.\nCurrying and Piping. Elm, like many functional languages, allows for functions to be partially applied. For example, if a function takes three arguments, you can give it one argument instead — and it will return a new function that takes two arguments! Elm developers use currying to reuse logic across their applications, and make their code more readable. In combination with the |> symbol (a.k.a. the pipe operator), currying can be a powerful tool.\nDecoders, Commands, and Subscriptions. Sometimes, it is necessary for an Elm application to talk to the outside world. You may need to parse JSON sent from your server, make an HTTP request to an API, use a third-party JavaScript library, or manipulate a part of the UI not rendered by your view function. In those cases, you will often have to tell Elm how to parse data it is receiving by using the Json.Decode module. You may also need to listen for changes to the outside world with Subscriptions or to trigger events outside of Elm using Commands.\n\nThere's so much to learn! Here are some resources to get you started:\n\nThe official Elm guide is a great resource, and gives a great rundown of some of the more complicated parts of the language.\nThe elm-tutorial project is an incredibly in-depth tutorial on building a single-page app using Elm.\nThe Elm Slack group is a great way to get in touch with other developers learning and using Elm. We even have our own #elmbridge channel for you to connect with volunteers and fellow students. You can also check out http://elm-lang.org/community for more ways to get involved in the Elm community!\n\nBut more than anything, the best way to learn Elm is to write more Elm! You now know more than enough to write complex and rich front-end applications in the language, and you'll pick up nuances of the language as you go. Good luck!\n"}}}
