# Welcome to ElmBridge!

Today, you're going to be learning elm! So exciting!

This tutorial is meant to be completed over the course of 5 hours, broken up into two chunks:
 - 1.5 hours on learning the basics of the language.
 - 3.5 hours building an elm application from scratch — specifically, an emoji translator!

By the end of this tutorial, you should:

- Know what elm is, and why people use it.
- Be familiar with the core data structures of the language.
- Understand the architecture of elm applications.
- Be able to build complex, rich front-end applications in elm.

Thanks for coming! Let's get started.

## Setup

We're going to be working with:

- The latest version of the elm language platform.
- The terminal.
- The text editor of your choice.
- The browser of your choice.

At various points today, you'll also be asked to download code from GitHub, so internet access is also required.

### Installing Elm

If you haven't done so already, follow [the official elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html) for installing the language platform.

You can verify everything is working by launching the elm REPL ([What is a REPL?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) from your terminal by running the following command:

```sh
$ elm-repl
```

If you see the following message, you are ready to go!

```sh
---- elm-repl 0.17.1 -----------------------------------------------------------
 :help for help, :exit to exit, more at <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-repl>
